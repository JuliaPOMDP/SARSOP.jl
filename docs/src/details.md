# Solver Details

`SARSOP.jl` is a wrapper for the [APPL SARSOP code](https://bigbird.comp.nus.edu.sg/pmwiki/farm/appl/). 
It provides an easy to use interface, that makes model and policy file generation simple. 

Details of the SARSOP algorithm can be found in in the [paper](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss04/p9.pdf) Kurniawati, Hanna, David Hsu, and Wee Sun Lee. "SARSOP: Efficient point-based POMDP planning by approximating optimally reachable belief spaces." Robotics: Science and Systems. 2008.
